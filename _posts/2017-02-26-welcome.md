# WeÎ»come

Welcome to _Partially Functional_ blog. 

It's been a while since I set up a blog page. Myriad of neat ~~toys~~ tools have sprung up and looks like blogging is much easier these days than ages ago when I first started with some Java articles on Google's [blogger](http://it-demystified.blogspot.co.uk/).

I have started looking into Scala towards the end of March 2016 and, after great many hours tinkering with it, I am still in love with the language. There's _so much_ to explore!  Fascinating ways of solving problems, wonderful community of developers, libraries that can do mind-bending stuff. Tons of great talks on YouTube/Vimeo. And last, but not least, I get to talk casually about _cats_ at work. _So much win!_



This page is here only to keep an empty blog from dying of starvation.

That's enough for a welcome article. [Explore my archive]({{ site.baseurl }}/archive)
