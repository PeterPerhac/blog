# WeÎ»come

Welcome to _Partially Functional_ blog. 

It's been a while since I set up a blog page. Myriad of neat ~~toys~~ tools have sprung up and looks like blogging is much easier these days than ages ago when I first started with some Java articles on Google's [blogger](http://it-demystified.blogspot.co.uk/).

I have started looking into Scala towards the end of March 2016 and, after great many hours tinkering with it, I am still in love with the language. There's _so much_ to explore!  Fascinating ways of solving problems, wonderful community of developers, libraries that can do mind-bending stuff. Tons of great talks on YouTube/Vimeo. And last, but not least, I get to talk casually about _cats_ at work. _So much win!_



**Resources I found particularly interesting:**

- [Martin Odersky's course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1)
- [Cats](http://typelevel.org/cats/)
- [Cats exercises](https://www.scala-exercises.org/cats/)
- [Pragmatic Scala book](http://amzn.to/2rR0g6I)
- [Advanced Scala with Cats e-book by Underscore](https://gumroad.com/l/advanced-scala)
- [Michael Pilquist's series of tutorials on YouTube](https://youtu.be/Dsd4pc99FSY)


The Learn [Learn you a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) book is a great way to learn functional programming concepts. It explains things like currying, type constructors, kinds, monoids, functors, applicative functors, monads in a very clear, easy-to-follow style. Yes, I know, it's not Scala. It's Haskell. And yes, you should learn you it for great good it will do you.

This page is here only to keep an empty blog from dying of starvation.

That's enough for a welcome article. [Explore my archive]({{ site.baseurl }}/archive)
