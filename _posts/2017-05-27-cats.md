So you have heard of _cats_ and you possibly heard of contravariant functors, monad transformers, applicatives and cartesians, and possibly even stumbled upon the term _Kleisli arrows_ and thought "_who needs this?_" Well, you don't _need_ this, but it doesn't hurt to learn a new thing or two. In this article I will show you a few examples of what you can do by just adding the **cats** library to your project's dependencies.



In a number of my previous posts I have expected you to have cats on your classpath. For example in this post about [parallel evaluation of Futures]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-05-23-concurrent-futures %})
