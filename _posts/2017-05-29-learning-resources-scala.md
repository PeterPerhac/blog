The [Learn you a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) book is a great way to learn functional programming concepts. It explains things like currying, type constructors, kinds, monoids, functors, applicative functors, monads in a very clear, easy-to-follow style. Yes, I know, it's not Scala. It's Haskell. And yes, you should learn you a Haskell. For great good it will do you.
