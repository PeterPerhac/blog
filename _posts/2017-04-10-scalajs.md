# Getting started with Scala.js

If any of the below is not working for you, perhaps check the [basic Scala.js tutorial](https://www.scala-js.org/tutorial/basic/)

 - install SBT and Node.js


Add the scala.js plugin to your plugins file (under `project/plugins.sbt`):

```scala
addSbtPlugin("org.scala-js" % "sbt-scalajs" % "0.6.15")
```



Make sure that in your `project/build.properties` file the version of SBT is **at least** 0.13.7

In your `build.sbt` file you need to enable the Scala.js plugin:

```scala
enablePlugins(ScalaJSPlugin)
```

If you're trying to add Scala.js stuff to an existing Play app, make sure you have separate sbt projects for each. Otherwise you'll come across `Scala.js cannot be run in a forked JVM` problem.  [Explained here](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js/issues/1590#issuecomment-92022209)
