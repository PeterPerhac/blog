            My name is Peter Perhac and you'll find me in Hove, UK.
            I have been sucked into the world of programming at the age of 11.
        </p>

        <p>
            I went from Visual Basic and C++ (very briefly) to Delphi (object pascal)
            where I stayed for a very long time (10 years).
            I picked up some SQL and JavaScript skills along the way,
            tried some PHP and C, did C# professionally for about a year,
            then moved to Java for about 6 years and in 2016 decided to give Scala a try.
        </p>

        <p>
            After a long search I think I found a language I can feel at home with 
            and enjoy diving into its depths with pleasure.
